My personal Mac setup, managed with nix-darwin and home-manager.
One repo, one command, and a fresh Mac ends up configured the same way every time.

## Contributing / Using This Repo

## What you get

Running the switch builds:

- System settings (dark mode, key repeat without press-and-hold, full keyboard dialogs, expanded save/print, dock, Finder path and status bars, 24h clock with seconds, screenshots to Pictures/Screenshots, trackpad tap and two-finger click, Touch ID for sudo, screensaver password immediately, app firewall)
- Homebrew apps (casks and CLI tools)
- Nix user packages (ripgrep, fd, fzf, jq, lazygit, Neovim, Node.js for the opt-in Pi npm install, Hack Nerd Font)
- Shell (zsh with autosuggestions, syntax highlighting, fzf fuzzy finding, zoxide smart cd, eza listings, bat previews, starship prompt)
- Editor (Neovim config with the Monokai Pro theme)
- Terminal (WezTerm config with the Monokai Pro theme and dimmed unfocused windows)
- Agent configs (Claude, Codex, opencode all share one AGENTS.md)
- Optional Pi theme and local extensions, generic UI settings and model overrides, plus two deliberately pinned third-party Pi packages

## Prerequisites

- Apple Silicon Mac, by default.
- Intel Mac: change one line.
  In `configuration.nix`, set `nixpkgs.hostPlatform = "x86_64-darwin";` (the comment right there tells you the same thing).
- Admin user, Xcode Command Line Tools (`bootstrap.sh` checks), FileVault on (warns if off), and latest macOS updates installed.

## Fresh-machine setup

On a brand new Mac, from a bare clone of this repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kynjal26/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
```

Before you run it: review "Make it yours" below.
Change the host label or CPU architecture if needed, and read the Homebrew cleanup warning.
`bootstrap.sh` applies the config to your machine, so do this first.

```sh
./bootstrap.sh
```

`bootstrap.sh` does six things, in order:

1. Checks fresh-Mac prerequisites (Xcode tools present, FileVault status).
2. Installs Determinate Nix, if it isn't already installed.
3. Symlinks this repo to `~/.dotfiles`.
   This has to happen before the first build, because `home.nix` points at config files through `~/.dotfiles`.
4. Checks the `user` configured in `flake.nix` against your actual macOS username, and offers to fix it for you if they differ.
5. Shows the plan (user, host, anything Homebrew `zap` will remove) and asks you to confirm.
6. Runs the first `darwin-rebuild switch`.
   It fetches the `darwin-rebuild` tool from the nix-darwin 26.05 release branch, then applies this repo's locked flake config.

After that, `darwin-rebuild` exists and you're on the normal workflow below.

### Validate without applying

Once Nix is installed (`bootstrap.sh` step 1 handles that), you can check that the config builds without touching your system - handy when you have edited something:

```sh
nix flake check --no-build
nix build .#darwinConfigurations.mac.system --dry-run
```

If you renamed the host label in "Make it yours", substitute your label for `mac` in these commands.

## Daily use

Edit the config files in place, then apply:

```sh
./rebuild.sh
```

That's it.
No separate build-and-copy step.

## Make it yours

This repo is mine.
If you clone it, review these before you run `bootstrap.sh`:

- **Username**: run `./bootstrap.sh` (it detects your macOS username and offers to set it) OR change the single `user = "kyngjune"` line in `flake.nix`.
  Everything else (`configuration.nix`, `home.nix`, home directory paths) is threaded from that one variable.
- **Git identities**: the `programs.git` block in `home.nix` currently carries two accounts (kynjal26 fallback, KingJune28 under `~/work/`).
  Forking? Replace both names, both noreply emails (find yours at `github.com/settings/emails`), and both forced credential usernames with your own, or collapse it to a single identity.
- **Host label** `"mac"`, in three places: `flake.nix` (the `darwinConfigurations."mac"` name), `rebuild.sh:5` (the `#mac` at the end of the flake reference), and `bootstrap.sh`'s first-switch command (also `#mac`).
  All three have to match.
- **CPU architecture**, `hostPlatform` in `configuration.nix` (see Prerequisites above).

**Git identity (two GitHub accounts, HTTPS, no SSH):** `home.nix` declares this via `programs.git`.
kynjal26 (with its noreply email) is the fallback everywhere; anything under `~/work/` switches commits and keychain credentials to KingJune28.
Emails are per-account `users.noreply.github.com` addresses so commits link to the right profile without exposing real emails.
After the first switch, store one token per account (they stay in your macOS keychain, never in this repo):

```sh
gh auth login   # repeat for the second account, then `gh auth switch --user <name>` picks the active one for `gh` commands
```

On github.com/settings/emails for both accounts, keep "Keep my email addresses private" on and consider "Block command line pushes that expose my email" as a safety net.
If you prefer one account or real emails, edit the `programs.git` block in `home.nix`.

**Homebrew cleanup warning:** `configuration.nix` sets `homebrew.onActivation.cleanup = "zap"`.
That means every time you switch, Homebrew removes any package or cask on your machine that isn't listed in the `brews` and `casks` arrays in `configuration.nix`.
If you already have Homebrew stuff installed that isn't in that list, the first switch will uninstall it.
Read through `brews` and `casks` before you run `bootstrap.sh` or `rebuild.sh` for the first time, and add anything you want to keep.

**About `herdr`:** it's in the `brews` list.
It's a real public Homebrew formula (`brew info herdr` finds it in homebrew-core, no tap needed), so it will install fine.
If you don't use it, just remove it from `brews` in your copy.

**Heads-up:**

- `home/AGENTS.md` is my personal agent policy, and `home.nix` installs it for Claude, Codex, and opencode.
  If you clone this repo, you'd silently inherit my agent instructions - edit or delete `home/AGENTS.md` if you don't want that.
- The `cc` and `co` shell aliases in `home.nix` are high-agency shortcuts: `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` and `codex --full-auto`.
  They're convenient for me, but know what they do before you use them.

## Repo tour

- `flake.nix` - the entry point.
  Wires up nixpkgs, nix-darwin, home-manager, and nix-homebrew, and declares the `mac` machine.
- `configuration.nix` - system-level config: macOS defaults, Homebrew.
- `home.nix` - user-level config: shell, packages, prompt, and the symlinks described below.
- `rebuild.sh` - re-applies the config after the first switch.
  Run this every time you make a change.
- `home/` - the actual config files that get symlinked into place; the sections below explain the shared symlink model and Pi's narrower selective setup.

## How the symlinks work

The files under `home/` are the real files - editing them here is editing your live config, no rebuild needed to see the change in your editor.
`home.nix` uses `mkOutOfStoreSymlink` to point paths like `~/.config/nvim` straight at `home/.config/nvim` in this repo, so the two never drift out of sync.
You only run `./rebuild.sh` when you change something that isn't just a symlinked file, like a package list or a system default.

## Optional Pi configuration

Pi is an opt-in CLI, not a dependency this repository vendors. Install it from its owner with the [official Pi instructions](https://pi.dev), for example:

```sh
npm install -g --ignore-scripts @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent
```

[Pi Launcher](https://github.com/kunchenguid/homebrew-tap) is also optional and installed from its owner, not declared by this config:

```sh
brew install --cask kunchenguid/tap/pi-launcher
```

Home Manager owns exactly two repository-authored Pi directories: `~/.pi/agent/themes` and `~/.pi/agent/extensions`. It also links `models.json` and `settings.json` as individual files. The local extension directory is for public, repository-authored extensions only - third-party package code never belongs there. Run `/reload` after editing a local extension or other Pi resources. The terminal-title extension shows a spinner while Pi is working, then a completion mark with the session name or current directory. The `monokai-pro` theme was matched to the Monokai Pro palette published by the open MIT-licensed [monokai-pro.nvim](https://github.com/loctvl842/monokai-pro.nvim) port and Pi's [public theme schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/earendil-works/pi/main/packages/coding-agent/src/modes/interactive/theme/theme-schema.json).

### Pi Calm

`home/.pi/agent/extensions/calm` is a standalone local Pi extension. Home Manager's existing global extensions-directory link makes Pi auto-load it without another declaration. `/calm` toggles a conversation-only presentation mode and is off by default. Its choice is stored locally in `~/.pi/agent/calm` (or the directory selected by `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`), not in this repository or Home Manager. Adapted from Firstmate under the bundled MIT license, Calm imports no Firstmate modules and has no Firstmate runtime dependency.

When enabled, Calm hides collapsed thinking and the call/result shells for Pi's seven built-in tools (`read`, `bash`, `edit`, `write`, `grep`, `find`, and `ls`) without leaving blank transcript rows. During an active run it replaces Pi's working row with a two-line animated blue-water, yellow-boat widget. `/calm` restores Pi's stock rendering and preserves the existing Ctrl+O tool-expansion choice.

Calm never changes prompts, tool execution, model context, session data, or ordering. `/share` and `/export` use the complete stock transcript. Generic custom tools, images, and unsupported Pi transcript classes deliberately remain visible because Pi has no safe general-purpose transcript filter. If a future Pi release no longer exports the exact collapsed-thinking rendering seam, Calm logs one diagnostic and leaves only that adapter disabled; all other behavior remains available.

Pi's package system declares two third-party sources in the linked global `settings.json`:

- `npm:pi-web-access@0.14.0` - the exact public npm release for web access.
- `npm:@ryan_nookpi/pi-extension-codex-fast-mode@0.2.6` - the exact public npm release from `ryan_nookpi`.

The versions are immutable pins, so Pi does not move them during package updates. Deliberate updates require a new source and security audit, followed by an explicit pin change in `home/.pi/agent/settings.json`. On Pi 0.82.0, global settings declarations install missing pinned packages automatically at startup. No one-time install command is required. Pi keeps the downloaded npm package trees in its own unmanaged `~/.pi/agent/npm` runtime directory, outside Home Manager and Git tracking.

Both packages execute with your full user permissions and must be trusted like any other executable code.

Home Manager deliberately does not manage `~/.pi/agent` itself, or Pi authentication, sessions, trust decisions, caches, npm/git package trees, or any other runtime state. The model overrides contain no credentials or endpoint settings, do not choose a default model, and only take effect after you authenticate Pi yourself. This remains an additive post-video layer: it does not install Pi, a launcher, or package source code into this repository.

## Notes

The first time you launch `nvim`, it bootstraps [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) by cloning plugins from GitHub.
That needs network access once; after that it's offline.
Neovim and WezTerm both use the Monokai Pro theme.
Neovim keeps italics off and uses a transparent background on macOS, Windows, and WSL so it matches the terminal setup.
